# Space-Invaders
Fun interactive arcade game made with Python!

This is a replica of the original Space Invaders arcade game, including copyright-free sounds, animation, graphics. It was my final project for my first computing course! To play the game, simply download the "invaders" folder into the current directory and type "python invaders" into your command prompt/terminal.
