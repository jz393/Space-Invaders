# Space-Invaders

This is a replica of the original Space Invaders arcade game, including copyright-free sounds, animation, graphics. It was my final project for my first computer science course [Cornell CS 1110], which made me totally fall in love with the major and switch to CS. To play the game, simply download the "invaders" folder into your current directory and type "python invaders" into your command prompt/terminal.
